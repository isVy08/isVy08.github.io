            <p class="caption" style="font-size: 14px;">
              I ran into someone from the past while in the mood of "All too well".
            </p>
            <p>
              How is it going?<br>
              I bet you're doing great<br>
              Saw you from the far<br>
              With a big smiley face
            </p>
            <p>
              Got one foot out the door<br>
              Part of me wanna stay<br>
              To say that I miss you<br>
              But ended up walking away<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              How's your skin these days?<br>
              Still itchy when summer comes?<br>
              Does it grow any thicker?<br>
              After everything you've done
            </p>
            <p>
              What's it like by the way?<br>
              To remain connected<br>
              Got nothing left in common<br>
              But somehow manage to stay
            </p>
            <p>
              Hope you've figured things out<br>
              Learned that time wouldn't stop<br>
              That youth doesn't come twice<br>
              So take chances if you could
            </p>
            <p>
              Wish I did more than just wave<br>
              But my mouth could barely speak<br>
              While my heart's busy bleeding<br>
              Since out of nowhere came a prick
            </p>
            <p>
              Just when thought it's over<br>
              Sadly turns out it's not<br>
              Will this pain last forever?<br>
              Should I again take a shot?
            </p>
            <p>
              Well in case you ask<br>
              I'd say I'm doing well<br>
              Met some guys forth and back<br>
              But scared to crack into hell
            </p>
            <p>
              You know I long for chemistry<br>
              At least like one we both had<br>
              Hope it's still in your memory<br>
              That it wasn't that bad
            </p>
            <p>
              Honestly how's it going?<br>
              Hope you're actually doing good<br>
              Don't be like me, I'm faking<br>
              Covering my tears with a hood
            </p>
            <p>
              Wondering if you remember<br>
              I still rank boys in my head<br>
              Around 5 and a quarter<br>
              Imagine what you would've said
            </p>
            <p>
              Gosh I miss your humor<br>
              Though oftentimes it's dark<br>
              And I'm still funny-looking<br>
              Running away when dogs bark
            </p>
            <p>
              They say be careful what you wish for<br>
              'Cuz things never what you expect<br>
              But hey it's November <br>
              Already struggling to forget. 
            </p>
