        <h1>Old Friend</h1>
        <p>
          Never thought I would drop by<br>
          The voice of yours took me by surprise<br>
          I was almost about to leave<br>
          The one thing I could not resist<br>

          Your smell brought me back to years ago<br>
          Memories wrapped in fragrant roses<br>
          Nicely laying on our way to school<br>
          You looked at me, I looked away, who could I fool ?<br>
          <br>
          How do I even begin ?<br>
          You followed me on the same old street<br>
          Filled with bumps and rainwater holes<br>
          Secretively and privately until we were home.<br>
          <br>
          No one knew and no one had to know<br>
          I put up guards and you dated her just for show<br>
          Lovingly hated you in disguise<br>
          Acted like I didn't care if you live or die<br>
          <br>
          Hey, old friend,<br>
          Can I call you that ?<br>
          Where has all the time flown ?<br>
          Promise me dazzling futures ahead<br>
          But not a warning against regrets?<br>
          <br>
          Hey, old friend<br>
          Has the time treated you well ?<br>
          All those years I've been on your trail<br>
          Busy making ends meet in a coffee shop,<br>
          where your finesse finally pays off ?<br>
          <br>
          Someone walked me to your orphanage<br>
          Which you never mentioned was dark and cold<br>
          And school to you was an awful cage<br>
          but it is my shiniest throne<br>
          <br>
          How do I even begin ?<br>
          You followed me on the same old street<br>
          Filled with bumps and rainwater holes<br>
          Secretively and privately,<br>
          <br>
          Until you made a wrong turn<br>
          Before my heart skipped a beat<br>
          A dropout is what they called you<br>
          Now the secret no one wants to believe<br>
          <br>
          Hey, old friend,<br>
          Do you know,<br>
          how the road not taken should have been?<br>
          When I became a girl more than a friend to you,<br>
          and you were a dream that came true<br>
          <br>
          No one's talked about you since<br>
          I wish someone had<br>
          Anamesis seems like a good old habit<br>
          Mourning for a demise of a friend<br>
          <br>
          How do I even begin ?<br>
          In this very room where roses are scattered<br>
          I looked at you, you smiled away, who a deep wound<br>
