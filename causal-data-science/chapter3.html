        <p>
          A <strong>causal model</strong> consists of a <strong>directed acyclic graph (DAG)</strong> over a set of random variables in which 
          each variable is a node, and depedencies among variables are encoded in the edges. 
          If there exists a directed edge pointing from a variable \(X\) to another variable \(Y\), we say \(X\) is a parent and a direct cause of \(Y\).
          A system of \(Y\) and all its parents form a <strong>causal mechanism</strong> for \(Y\). 
          In such a mechanism, the value of \(Y\) is determined by the value of its parents through a stochastic function \(f\).
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="chapter1.html">Chapter 1</a> introduces Bayesian Network as a toolkit to translate graphical language to probabilistic language. 
          <strong>\(d-\)Separation</strong> is a test for graphical independency through the notion of <strong>blockage</strong>. 
          According to <strong>Global Markov Assumption</strong>, the conditional independence yielded by a graph \(G\) licenses conditional independence with respect to the joint probability distribution \(P\),
          given that \(P\) adheres to the chain rule of Bayesian Network relative to \(G\). 
        </p>  
        <p>
          The entire paradigm is buit upon a set of assumptions that render conditions under which causal inference frameworks can be applied. 
          This means whenever given a dataset with probability distribution \(P\) and a causal graph \(G\), we must first test whether \(P\) and \(G\) are compatible. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We have also explained why correlation does not imply causation by examining the concept of <strong>Intervention</strong>. 
          Statistical estimand \(P(Y|X)\) embedded in observational data is referred to <strong>associational distribution</strong>, 
          while <strong>interventional distribution</strong> \(P(Y|do(X))\) is obtained through doing interventions on \(X\). 
          The causal estimand \(P(Y|do(X))\) is what to be established for deriving the causal effect of \(X\) on \(Y\), while \(P(Y|X)\) is often a spurious signal.
        </p>
        <p>     
          Doing interventions is equivalent to conducting experiments by nature, specifically controlled randomized experiments. 
          Part II will delineate why randomization is the key to causation, and the capacity of performing large-scale experiments efficiently is a valuable assset that tech companies should continue to exploit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intervention assumes the causal mechanisms are <strong>localized</strong> and <strong>independent</strong>. This means intervention on a variable only impacts its causal mechanism, leaving the rest of the system intact.  
          The graph corresponding to intervention on a node is one constructed by deleting all arrows pointing into that node. 
          Intervention on SCM is done by replacing the right-hand side of the structural equation with the value or distribution imposed by the intervention.

          Unfortunately, experimentation is not always feasible while observational data is massive. This is when Causal Inference wields its power.
          <a href="chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a> presents fundamental techniques to <strong>identify</strong> causal effects from observational data with respect to a given causal model.
          The goal is to transform causal estimands involving the \(do\) operator into statistical quantities to be computed from the data. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          Non-parametric methods are generally preferable since they do not rely on any particular functional forms.
          <a href="chapter2.html#2.1">Back-door criterion</a> is the simplest solution to blocking confounding paths, which is however challenging in practice due to unobserved confounders. 
          <a href="chapter2.html#2.2">Front-door criterion</a> is proposed to address this limitation. \(Do-\)calculus is a set of inference rules to eliminate the \(do\) operator in a general setting.  
          With a specified structural equation, <a href="chapter2.html#2.6">Instrumental variable</a> can be exploited for identification if such a variable can be found.
