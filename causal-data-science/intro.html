        <h2>Why A/B Testing?</h2>
        <p>
          <i>" When in doubt, do experiments ! "</i> -  myself
          <br><br>
          A/B testing is an experimental method that compares the performance between two versions of a solution. 
          Need no introduction, A/B testing is a natural way to escape from your maze of observational assumptions and get into the minds of users to understand how they actually respond to your offerings. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Statistically, it is one basic form of randomized controlled experiments. Because it has been heavily adopted in tech firms for product development, the term is often used interchangeably with <strong>Online Controlled Experiment</strong>. 
          Experimental data provides insights about the world that cannot be derived from pure correlations held within observational data alone.  
          In such tests, randomization is the key to validating the effect of a treatment, in other words to establishing cause and effect relationships. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Why we should care about causal relations is a must-have introduction in nearly all literature and write-ups related to Causal Inference. From a practical viewpoint, answering the <i>Why</i> questions is fundamental to decision making. 
          It is impossible to find a satisfactory solution or to know exactly what actions to take unless we understand the underlying causes of an issue.   
        </p>
        <p>
          The importance of being causal is intuitively beyond question. If you are not convinced, lazily go through my 2-minute article <a href="../causality/causality-1.html" target="_blank">Intro to Causal Thinking</a>, in which I describe my struggle to act on statistical correlations that might resonate with you.
        </p>
        <h2>A Reason to Begin</h2>
        <p>
          The situation is, you have a treatment \(T\) (e.g., a red button) and a desired outcome \(Y\) (e.g, increased click-through rate). The fundamental question is
          $$\textit{Does changing the button color to red make users click more?}$$
          This leads to several pain points such as
          <li>How can I verify that \(T\) will cause \(Y\)? </li>
          <li>How can I quantify this effect?</li>
          <li>If not \(T\), what truly causes Y and how can I find it?</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          The rule is, any statistical associations found in a randomized controlled experiment are causal relations. 
          Given the power of technology and prevalence of the Internet, the question is no longer about how to run an A/B test, but it has become how to properly design and conduct one from which causal effects can arise.   
          Only then can we start discussing how to calculate and validate such effects.
        </p>
        <p>
           However, things can get more complicated that. What if the experiment fails, or what should we do when an experiment is not feasible?
        </p>
        <p>
          The list goes on. Luckily, research progress in the field of Causal Inference can help us address most of these challenges.
        </p>
        <h2>The Scope</h2>
        <p>
         This tutorial simply provides an overview of Causal Inference in the context of A/B testing. It covers fundamental concepts in Causal Inference while sheds light on the way it fits into the landscape of product development.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tutorial is specfically intended for readers with zero background in Causal Inference but with foundations in Statistics. I hope to give some guidelines on how to go beyond correlations and derive cause-effect relationships. 
          At the end of this, you are expected to know what steps to take in order to answer your casual questions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I mainly focus on the Causal aspects, and though I will briefly discuss practical scenarios that complicate the computation of causal effects, I do <strong>not</strong> dive into A/B testing itself. 
          I therefore refer you to this book <a href="https://experimentguide.com/">Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments: A Practical Guide to A/B Testing</a>, which is an excellent material written by top experts from Microsoft, Google and LinkedIn.
          If you are not familiar with A/B testing, make sure you take <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/a-refresher-on-ab-testing ">this quick refresher</a> beforehand.

        </p>
        <h2>The Roadmap</h2>
        <p>
          The first step is to familiarize you with some terminologies and assumptions for a causal analysis. 
          We then start with a perfect scenario in which a randomized experiment is feasible and well-designed. I will introduce how and to what extent you can determine whether a treatment takes effect. 
          After that, we will examine real-world scenarios which complicate the measures of causal effect. 
        </p>
        <p>
          But experiments are not always viable while observational data is prevalent and massive. Here comes the power of Causal Inference: if we assume there is an underlying causal structure in the observational data, there are formal techniques to derive causal quantities from statistical ones. 
          This requires a causal (often graphical) model to begin with. 
          We will later see what a causal model is about, how to construct one, under what assumptions we are able to estimate causal relations and how. 
          Finally, I hope to wrap this up with case studies from how tech firms such as LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber apply Causal Inference (spoilers, they have a dedicated team of data scientists for this), and walk you through some tools to automate the computation.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Until that point, we will have tackled the issues of <strong>Identification</strong> and <strong>Estimation</strong>. 
          However, there is another bottleneck: identifying a causal graph, or in general discovering causal structure is an extremely daunting task. This is a challenge of <strong>Causal Discovery</strong> and <strong>Structure Learning</strong>, which has not yet been completely solved. 
          We will take a peek at what researchers have done so far. 
        </p>

        <h3>On a personal note,</h3>
        <p>
          It is the Book of Why (Pearl & Mackenzie 2018) that got me excited about Data Science in the first place. I believe causality is the ultimate goldmine to dig - data cannot speak for itself. The beauty of data is not in the glamorous visualizations we build, rather lies in the yet-to-be-discovered insights that explain the world around us and inform actions to make meaningful changes accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tutorial is motivated by nothing but a personal goal to master Causal Inference. I can only write as much as I learn and admit to just scratching the surface. 
          This should thus be treated as a pocket tutorial and by no means replace formal training. 
          Every single topic / sub-topic has its own dedicated research area, so I will further provide useful references, from which I highly encourage you to do additional reading in your own time. 
          If you come across any good reads or get struck by ideas, loop me in the discussion.
