      <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <article class="post" style="text-align: justify;">
      <p>
        While Causal Inference has been a well-developed research field for over two decades, its applicability in the industry remains highly limited. 
        A thorough explanation of cause and effect is fundamental to decision making particularly in todayâ€™s multi-faceted and increasingly complex environments. According to a <a href="https://www.causalscience.org/blog/causal-data-science-in-practice/">survey conducted by Maastricht University & Copenhagen Business School</a> in 2021, 
        even though companies have already lived and breathed Big Data, causal methods are not yet widely adopted. One major roadblock is the lack of foundation on theoretical frameworks and practical skills to apply them effectively. 
        Not only data analysts and scientists face this education gap, but even management has not realized the importance of using causal data science methods to improve their business. 
        This calls for more efforts to bridge this gap and promote accessibility to knowledge of Causal Inference to a broader public.
      </p>
      <h2>A Reason To Begin</h2>
      <p>
        Causal Inference provides powerful techniques for evaluating the impact of strategic actions and investigating causal factors that influence various areas of the business. 
        Data practitioners are long familiar with the adage Correlation is not Causation, but find it difficult to go beyond correlation to establish any causal conclusions about our analysis. 
        We data scientists are seriously deprived of the tools and capability to dig deeper into the data goldmine, and must instead resort to statistical techniques that barely scratch the surface.   
      </p>
      <h2>Why This Tutorial</h2>
      <p>
        This tutorial is intended for analysts and data scientists with zero background in Causal Inference but wishing to learn to integrate causal methods into their data analysis pipelines. This beginner's guide aims to provide a general picture of how Causal Inference is applied in practice while equipping you with a minimally sufficient foundation only for the sake of application. 
        Thus, it should only be treated as a pocket tutorial and by no means replace formal training. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are indeed plenty of good resources on Causal Inference, but very few of them are friendly to non-academics. I myself struggled to go through the materials in the beginning despite a strong background in statistics. My tutorial approaches Causal Inference from a hands-on perspective. Every discussion of a certain topic is restricted to essential or strongly related concepts that aid your understanding. A bright side is that we do have software tools and libraries developed to automate the implementation. 
        I therefore focus on introducing the key ideas to build up intuition and highlighting the connections among frameworks, leaving the technical details handled by computers.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Since you may find it incomprehensive, I also provide a handy list of materials to enrich your knowledge. 
        You can always trace the references therein for alternative selection of reads.

      <h2>Contents</h2>
      <p>
        The tutorial contains 4 parts:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Part I: Fundamentals </strong> covers funamental concepts of Causal Inference under the paradigm of probabilistic graphical models.
            This part clarifies what we mean by cause and effect while offers various methods to make causal claims out of non-experiment data.

              <li><a href="1-2-causal-effect-identification.html">Chapter 2. Identifying Causal Effects</a></li>
              <li>Chapter 3. A Big Picture (Coming Soon)</li>
            </ul>
            </li><br>
          <li>
            <strong style="color:gray">Part II: Experimentation</strong> discusses the importance of experimentation in determining causal effects, along with several caveats in designing and conducting experiments that may affect the reliability of your causal results.
            We will examine Causal Inference from a different perspective - under a framework called Potential Outcome. 
          </li><br>
          <li>
            <strong style="color:gray">Part III: Tools</strong> introduces a number of tools and libraries that supports implementation of Causal Inference in practice. 
            This includes coding tutorials and comprehensive comparison of these tools.
          </li><br>
          <li>
            <strong style="color:gray">Part IV: Applications</strong> provides case studies on how tech firms such as LinkedIn, Apple, Facebook, Uber adopt Causal Inference for forecasting and product development.
            At the same time, it presents more complicated scenarios where causal methods are difficult to apply. 
          </li>

      <h2>Prerequisite</h2>
      <p>
        Basic knowledge of Statistics, Probability and Python is required. It also requires a bit of patience on your first touch with Causal Inference.
        If you struggle to understand, please remember that it is very natural when acquiring a new knowledge. And I am here to help. 
        Feel free to drop me an email at <strong>causalguide[at]gmail.com</strong> if you need a refresher on any of these topics.   
      </p>
      <h2>Resources</h2>
      <p>
        The following books are particularly useful to me. 
        These are formal readings to solidify your understanding. I rank them from the easiest to most difficult to beginners.
