      <h3 id="4.1">4.1. Counterfactuals</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose you have a headache, you are made to take a pill and observe that the headache goes away.
        This is, again, an example of intervention and its outcome is the causal effect of the pill on your headache.
        A counterfactual query is that given the fact that you are cured of the headache,
        would it still disappear had you not taken the pill?
        Doing this requires us to <strong>imagine</strong> what would happen if something did not happen in real world
        had happened in the past, that is to engage in a <strong>counterfactual</strong> world.
        Such a question can never be answered simply through observational data nor controlled experiments
        (you cannot redo the experiment!).
      </p>
      <h3 id="4.2">4.2. Mediation Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        In section <a href="chapter1.html#1">1.1</a>, we briefly mentioned \(M\) as a mediator in the causal path from
        \(X\) to \(Y\). Until this point, we have seen two cases of using mediators: a mediator can be used as a
        <a href="chapter2.html#2.2">front-door criterion</a> to estimate causal effects in the presence of possible
        unobserved confounders, or the effect of a mediator on the outcome variable can be identified from
        <a href="chapter2.html#2.6">instrumental variables</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The setting of Mediation Analysis given in Figure 4.1, where the effect of \(X\) on \(Y\) goes through two
        paths: the <strong>direct</strong> path \(X \rightarrow Y\) and the <strong>indirect</strong> path transmitted
        through \(X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y\).
      </p>
      <figure style="text-align: center;">
        <img src='figures/1-4-Fig1.png' alt='graphs' width="500" />
        <figcaption style="font-size: small;">Figure 4.1</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The SCM for such a graph is
        $$M = f_M(X, U_M)$$
        $$X = f_X(U_X)$$
        $$Y = f_Y(X, M, U_Y)$$
      </p>

      Suppose \(X\) changes from \(x_1\) to \(x_2\), we say there is a causal effect of \(X\) on \(Y\) if
      $$E[Y|do(X=x_1)] - E[Y|do(X=x_2)] \ne 0$$
      </p>

      <p>
        The effect of \(X\) on \(Y\) is broken into:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h5>Total Effect:</h5>
          $$TE = E[f_Y(x_2, f_M(x_2, U_M), U_Y)] - E[f_Y(x_1, f_M(x_1, U_M), U_Y)]$$
          $$TE = E[Y|do(X=x_2)] - E[Y|do(X=x_1)]$$
          <p>
            \(TE\) measures the expected change in the outcome \(Y\) when \(X\) changes from \(X=x_1\) to \(X=x_2\).
            The total effect already incorporates changes in \(M\) induced by intervention on \(X\).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Controlled Direct Effect:</h5>
          $$CDE(m) = E[f_Y(x_2, f_M(m, U_M), U_Y)] - E[f_Y(x_1, f_M(m, U_M), U_Y)]$$
          $$CDE(m) = E[Y|do(X=x_2, M=m)] - E[Y|do(X=x_1, M=m)]$$
          <p>
            \(CDE\) measures the expected change in the outcome \(Y\) when \(X\) changes \(X=x_1\) to \(X=x_2\), and
            <strong>\(M\) is set to a pre-specified level \(M=m\) over the entire population.</strong>
            It is called controlled direct effect because we control for the effect of the mediator, by interventioning
            on \(M\) (\(M\) in the \(do\) operator).
            We do not simply statistically condition on \(M\) because it may open up some back-door path where \(M\) is
            a collider.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Natural Direct Effect:</h5>
          $$NDE = E[f_Y(x_2, f_M(x_1, U_M), U_Y)] - E[f_Y(x_1, f_M(x_1, U_M), U_Y)]$$
          $$NDE = E[Y_{x_2, M_{x_1}}] - E[Y_{x_1, M_{x_1}}]$$
          <p>
            \(NDE\) measures the expected change in the outcome \(Y\) when \(X\) changes \(X=x_1\) to \(X=x_2\), while
            <strong>\(M\) is set to the value it <span style="color:darkblue">would have obtained</span> before \(X\)
              changes, i.e., under \(X=x_1\).</strong>
            The second line simply introduces the notations assigned to the quantities in the first line for brevity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Natural Indirect Effect:</h5>
          $$NIE = E[f_Y(x_1, f_M(x_2, U_M), U_Y)] - E[f_Y(x_1, f_M(x_1, U_M), U_Y)] $$
          $$NIE = E[Y_{x_1, M_{x_2}}] - E[Y_{x_1, M_{x_1}}]$$
        </li>
        <p>
          \(NIE\) measures the expected change in the outcome \(Y\)
          <strong>when \(X\) is held constant at \(X=x_1\), and \(M\) is set to the value it <span
              style="color:darkblue">would have obtained</span> in case \(X\) changes from \(x_1\) to \(x_2\).</strong>
        </p>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4 id="4.2.1">4.2.1. Intuition</h4>
        <p>
          &#8811 \(CDE\) would take different values corresponding the level of \(M\) is set to. \(CDE\) answers the
          question "How would \(X\) affect \(Y\) when \(M\) was held fixed at \(m\)?".
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8811 \(NDE\) addresses the concern "Suppose \(M\) did not respond to changes in \(X\), how would the effect
          be?" You can think of this case as \(CDE\) where \(m\) is chosen to be the value it takes before the change.
          However, it is called <i>natural</i> because \(NDE\) measures the effect transmitted to \(Y\) by preventing
          \(M\) from responding to changes in \(X\) i.e., disabling the indirect causal path.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8811 \(NIE\) examines a scenario where in reality we do not intervene on \(X\), but magically know the
          values \(M\) would take had the change to \(X\) been in place. \(NIE\) quantifies the portion
          of effect <i>explained by</i> \(M\) by disabling the direct causal effect.
        </p>

        <p>
          I further introduce the <strong>Reverse Natural Indirect Effect \(NIE_r\)</strong>, constructing by exchanging
          \(x_1\) with \(x_2\)
          $$NIE_r = E[f_Y(x_2, f_M(x_1, U_M), U_Y)] - E[f_Y(x_2, f_M(x_2, U_M), U_Y)] $$
          $$NIE_r = E[Y_{x_2, M_{x_1}}] - E[Y_{x_2, M_{x_2}}]$$
        </p>


        <p>
          You should notice that the <span style="color:darkblue; font-weight: bold;">would have</span> notions of
          natural effects give rise to the counterfactual terms where the input \(X\) value to compute \(M\) is
          different from the value \(X\) is set to. When they are equal, which is equivalent to allowing the causal
          effect to pass through to \(M\), we end up with the interventional distribution. Hence,
          $$E[Y_{x_2, M_{x_2}}] = E[Y|do(X=x_2)], E[Y_{x_1, M_{x_1}}] = E[Y|do(X=x_1)]$$

          A careful observation gives us (try proving this yourself)
          $$TE = NDE - NIE_r$$
        </p>
