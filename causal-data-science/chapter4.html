      <h3 id="4.1">4.1. Counterfactuals</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose you have a headache, you are made to take a pill and observe that the headache goes away.
        This is, again, an example of intervention and its outcome is the causal effect of the pill on your headache.
        A counterfactual query is that given the fact that you are cured of the headache,
        would it still disappear had you not taken the pill?
        Doing this requires us to <strong>imagine</strong> what would happen if something did not happen in real world
        had happened in the past, that is to engage in a <strong>counterfactual</strong> world.
        Answering such a question is not always feasible since you cannot redo the experiment.
        Fortunately, under certain conditions, we can estimate counterfactual effects through observational and
        interventional data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following discusses steps to determine counterfactual quantities at the unit or individual level.
        This requires a parametric form for our SCM. Let's examine this example.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let \(Q\) be the quantity of products sold, \(P\) be price per unit of your company and \(C\) be price per unit
        of your competitor. The SCM is given as
        $$Q = 2C - P + U_Q$$
        $$P = 0.8C+ U_P$$
        \(U_Q, U_P\) are repsectively unobserved additive noise variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last year, your product was priced at \(P = \$2\), the competitor's product was priced at \(C = \$3\)
        and \(10\) units was sold.
      </p>
      <i>Question 1: How many units would your company have sold if the price had been reduced to \(\$1\),
        <strong>holding everything else unchanged</strong>?
      </i>

      <ul>
        <strong>Step 1 (Abduction):</strong>
        Use the factual evidence to estimate the exogenous variables \(U_Q\) and \(U_P\).
        $$ U_Q = Q - 2C + P = 10 - 2 \times 3 + 2 = 6$$
        $$ U_P = P - 0.8C = 2 - 0.8 \times 3 = - 0.4$$
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <strong>Step 2 (Action):</strong>
        Use the \(do-\)operator to change the model to reflect the counterfactual assumption being made.
        Conducting the intervention \(do(P) = 1\) results in the manipulated SCM
        $$Q = 2C - 1 + U_Q$$
        $$P = 1$$
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <strong>Step 3 (Prediction):</strong>
        Use the modified model and updated information about the unobserved factors to calculate the counterfactual
        effects
        $$Q_{P=2, Q=3}(P=1) = 2 \times 3 - 1 + 6 = 11$$
        The notation \(Q_{P=2, Q=3}(P=1)\) indicates the counterfactual quantity is quantified given the known reality
        of \(P=2, Q=3\). This quantity is fundamentally different from \(Q(P=1)\), which in this case measures the
        causal effect of changing the price.
      </ul>
      <i>Question 2: How many units would your company have sold if your competitor had set their price at \(\$1\)?
      </i>
      <ul>
        <strong>Step 1 (Abduction):</strong> Same as above
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <strong>Step 2 (Action):</strong> The modified SCM with respect to the intervention \(do(Q) = 1\) is
        $$Q = 2 \times 1 - P + U_Q$$
        $$P = 0.8 \times 1 + U_P$$
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <strong>Step 3 (Prediction):</strong> Because \(C\) influences \(P\), we must first factor in the resulting
        change in \(P\) at the new level of \(C\)
        $$P = 0.8 \times 1 - 0.4 = 0.4$$
        The counterfactual effect is
        $$Q_{P=2, Q=3}(Q=1) = 2 \times 1 - 0.4 + 6 = 7.6$$
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your sales would have been reduced had the competitor lowered their price. In question 2, you allow your
        product's price
        to respond to the changes in the competitor's price. Alternatively, you may be interested in
        what the effect would be had the competitor reduced the price while your priced remained fixed.
        The intervention would now be \(\{do(Q) = 1, do(P) = 2\}\). The counterfactual effect becomes
        $$Q_{P=2, Q=3}(Q=1, P=2) = 2 \times 1 - 2 + 6 = 6$$
        This means you would have to lower your price accordingly to remain competitive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here we only examine the simplest case wherein our structural equations are deterministic.
        A more complicated case is when the exogenous variables vary stochastically or even when
        the functions \(Q, P\) is not invertible to compute \(U\) values.
        Stochastic and population-level counterfactual inference are beyond the scope of this book.
        Advanced readers are encouraged to visit

      <p>
        We now move on to Mediation Analysis - one important application of Counterfactuals.
      </p>
      <h3 id="4.2">4.2. Mediation Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        In section <a href="chapter1.html#1">1.1</a>, we briefly mentioned \(M\) as a mediator in the causal path from
        \(X\) to \(Y\). Until this point, we have seen two cases of using mediators: a mediator can be used as a
        <a href="chapter2.html#2.2">front-door criterion</a> to estimate causal effects in the presence of possible
        unobserved confounders, or the effect of a mediator on the outcome variable can be identified from
        <a href="chapter2.html#2.6">instrumental variables</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The setting of Mediation Analysis given in Figure 4.1, where the effect of \(X\) on \(Y\) goes through two
        paths: the <strong>direct</strong> path \(X \rightarrow Y\) and the <strong>indirect</strong> path transmitted
        through \(X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y\). The unobserved factors may or may not be correlated with one another.
      </p>
      <figure style="text-align: center;">
        <img src='figures/1-4-Fig1.png' alt='graphs' width="500" />
        <figcaption style="font-size: small;">Figure 4.1</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The SCM for such a graph is
        $$M = f_M(X, U_M)$$
        $$X = f_X(U_X)$$
        $$Y = f_Y(X, M, U_Y)$$
      </p>

      Suppose \(X\) changes from \(x_1\) to \(x_2\), we say there is a causal effect of \(X\) on \(Y\) if
      $$E[Y|do(X=x_1)] - E[Y|do(X=x_2)] \ne 0$$
      </p>

      <p>
        The effect of \(X\) on \(Y\) is broken into:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h5>Total Effect:</h5>
          $$TE = E[f_Y(x_2, f_M(x_2, U_M), U_Y)] - E[f_Y(x_1, f_M(x_1, U_M), U_Y)]$$
          $$TE = E[Y|do(X=x_2)] - E[Y|do(X=x_1)]$$
          <p>
            \(TE\) measures the expected change in the outcome \(Y\) when \(X\) changes from \(X=x_1\) to \(X=x_2\).
            The total effect already incorporates changes in \(M\) induced by intervention on \(X\).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Controlled Direct Effect:</h5>
          $$CDE(m) = E[f_Y(x_2, f_M(m, U_M), U_Y)] - E[f_Y(x_1, f_M(m, U_M), U_Y)]$$
          $$CDE(m) = E[Y|do(X=x_2, M=m)] - E[Y|do(X=x_1, M=m)]$$
          <p>
            \(CDE\) measures the expected change in the outcome \(Y\) when \(X\) changes \(X=x_1\) to \(X=x_2\), and
            <strong>\(M\) is set to a pre-specified level \(M=m\) over the entire population.</strong>
            It is called controlled direct effect because we control for the effect of the mediator, by interventioning
            on \(M\) (\(M\) in the \(do\) operator).
            We do not simply statistically condition on \(M\) because it may open up some back-door path where \(M\) is
            a collider.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Natural Direct Effect:</h5>
          $$NDE = E[f_Y(x_2, f_M(x_1, U_M), U_Y)] - E[f_Y(x_1, f_M(x_1, U_M), U_Y)]$$
          $$NDE = E[Y_{x_2, M_{x_1}}] - E[Y_{x_1, M_{x_1}}]$$
          <p>
            \(NDE\) measures the expected change in the outcome \(Y\) when \(X\) changes \(X=x_1\) to \(X=x_2\), while
            <strong>\(M\) is set to the value it <span style="color:darkblue">would have obtained</span> before \(X\)
              changes, i.e., under \(X=x_1\).</strong>
            The second line simply introduces the notations assigned to the quantities in the first line for brevity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Natural Indirect Effect:</h5>
          $$NIE = E[f_Y(x_1, f_M(x_2, U_M), U_Y)] - E[f_Y(x_1, f_M(x_1, U_M), U_Y)] $$
          $$NIE = E[Y_{x_1, M_{x_2}}] - E[Y_{x_1, M_{x_1}}]$$
        </li>
        <p>
          \(NIE\) measures the expected change in the outcome \(Y\)
          <strong>when \(X\) is held constant at \(X=x_1\), and \(M\) is set to the value it <span
              style="color:darkblue">would have obtained</span> in case \(X\) changes from \(x_1\) to \(x_2\).</strong>
        </p>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4 id="4.2.1">4.2.1. Intuition</h4>
        <p>
          \(&#8811 CDE\) would take different values corresponding the level of \(M\) is set to. \(CDE\) answers the
          question "How would \(X\) affect \(Y\) when \(M\) was held fixed at \(m\)?".
        </p>
        <p>
          \(&#8811 NDE\) addresses the concern "Suppose \(M\) did not respond to changes in \(X\), how would the effect
          be?" You can think of this case as \(CDE\) where \(m\) is chosen to be the value it takes before the change.
          However, it is called <i>natural</i> because \(NDE\) measures the effect transmitted to \(Y\) by preventing
          \(M\) from responding to changes in \(X\) i.e., disabling the indirect causal path.
        </p>
        <p>
          \(&#8811 NIE\) examines a scenario where in reality we do not intervene on \(X\), but magically know the
          values \(M\) would take had the change to \(X\) been in place. \(NIE\) quantifies the portion
          of effect <i>explained by</i> \(M\) by disabling the direct causal effect.
        </p>

        <p>
          I further introduce the <strong>Reverse Natural Indirect Effect \(NIE_r\)</strong>, constructing by exchanging
          \(x_1\) with \(x_2\)
          $$NIE_r = E[f_Y(x_2, f_M(x_1, U_M), U_Y)] - E[f_Y(x_2, f_M(x_2, U_M), U_Y)] $$
          $$NIE_r = E[Y_{x_2, M_{x_1}}] - E[Y_{x_2, M_{x_2}}]$$
        </p>

        <p>
          You should notice that the <span style="color:darkblue; font-weight: bold;">would have</span> notions of
          natural effects give rise to the counterfactual terms where the input \(X\) value to compute \(M\) is
          different from the value \(X\) is set to. When they are equal, which is equivalent to allowing the causal
          effect to pass through to \(M\), we end up with the interventional distribution. Hence,
          $$E[Y_{x_2, M_{x_2}}] = E[Y|do(X=x_2)], E[Y_{x_1, M_{x_1}}] = E[Y|do(X=x_1)]$$

          A careful observation gives us (try proving this yourself)
          $$TE = NDE - NIE_r$$
        </p>
        <h4 id="4.2.2">4.2.2. Identifying Natural Effects</h4>
        <p>
          This section presents sufficient conditions for identifying the natural direct effects and the natural
          indirect effects. The knowledge is gratefully extracted from the paper
          <a href="https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r389.pdf">Interpretation and Identification of Causal
            Mediation</a> (Pearl 2014).
          The notion of identifiability is similar to what is applied to causal (interventional)
          quantities: we seek to reduce the counterfactual probabilities to observational or interventional ones to be
          estimated with techniques provided in <a href="chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key condition that renders this practice possible is <strong
            style="color: darkred;">unconfoundeness</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="theorem">
          <h5>Definition of Unconfoundeness and Deconfounder:</h5>
          <p>
            \(X\) and \(Y\) are said to be <strong>unconfounded</strong> if the variables influencing \(X\) are
            independent of those influencing \(Y\) when \(X\) is held fixed.
            A covariate or set of variates \(W\) is said to <strong>deconfound</strong> the relationship between
            \(X\) and \(Y\) if conditioning \(W\) blocks all back-door paths between them.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Let's revisit Figure 1.2* where \(Z\) is a common cause of \(X\) and \(Y\) and it is called a
          <strong>confounder</strong>. Note again that \(Z\) can be a set of common causes.

        </p>
        <figure style="text-align: center;">
          <img src='figures/1-2-Fig.png' alt='graphs' width="500" />
          <figcaption style="font-size: small;">Figure 1.2*</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          In this example, \(Z\) is also called a <strong>deconfounder</strong> because conditioning on \(Z\) blocks the
          <a href="chapter2.html#2.1">back-door</a> path that produces spurious correlations between \(X\) and \(Y\).
          In Figure 4.1, the \(M \rightarrow Y\) relationship is confounded both through \(X\) and through latent
          factors underlying the dashed path between \(U_M\) and \(U_Y\). \(X\) here is a confounder, but not a
          deconfounder since conditioning on \(X\) is not sufficient to block all back-door paths.
          The set \(W = \{X, U_M\}\) or \(W = \{X, U_Y\}\) would do the work, however,
          only if either \(U_M\) or \(U_Y\) is measurable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recall that the setting for a causal mediation problem is described in Figure 4.1.
          There are two main sets of conditions, \(A\) and \(B\), that are sufficient for identifying both natural
          effects. Each set is accompanied by its own formula.

        </p>
        <h5>Assumption set \(A\):</h5>
        <ol>
          There exists a set of measure covariates \(W\) such that
          <br><br>
          <li>No member of \(W\) is a descendent of \(X\)</li><br>
          <li>
            \(W\) blocks all back-door paths from \(M\) to \(Y\) not going through \(X\).
            Holding \(X\) constant, \(W\) deconfounds the \(M \rightarrow Y\) relationship
          </li><br>
          <li>\(P(m|do(t),w)\): the \(W\)-specific effect of \(X\) on \(M\) is identifiable</li><br>
          <li>\(P(y|do(t,m),w)\): the \(W\)-specific joint effect of \(\{X,M\}\) on \(Y\) is identifiable</li>

        </ol>
        <h6>
          When conditions \(A1\) and \(A2\) hold, the natural effects are identified as
        </h6>
        <p>
          \(&#8811 (1a) \ NDE = \sum_m \sum_w [E(Y|do(X=x_2, M=m), W=w) - E(Y|do(X=x_1, M=m), W=w)] \)

        </p>
        <h6>
          When conditions \(A1\) through \(A4\) hold, the \(do-\)expressions are reduced to observational quantities.

        <p>
          Without \(A3\) and \(A4\), we would have to conduct randomized experiments to substantiate the interventional

        <h3 id="4.3">4.3. Case Study: Simpson's Paradox in COVID 19</h3>
        <p>

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox">Simpson's Paradox</a>
          was once a tough puzzle to statisticians until Causal Infernece came in explaining it nicely with a
          simple causal graph. The paradox has recently made its appearance in <a
            href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07180.pdf">an analysis of COVID-19 case
            fatility rates (CFRs)</a> across different countries.
          The dataset consists of \(756,004\) confirmed Covid-19 cases and \(68,508\) fatalities reported from
          \(11\) different countries and segregated into age groups of \(10\)-year intervals.
        </p>

          <figcaption style="font-size: small;">
            Figure 4.2 (taken from the paper): (left) Covid-19 case fatality rates (CFRs) in Italy and China by age
            group and in aggregated form (“Total”). (right) Proportion of cases within each age group.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          An classic paradoxical pattern is observed:
          <strong>for all age groups, CFRs in Italy are lower than those in China, but the total CFR in Italy is higher
            than that in China. </strong>

        </p>
        <p>
          Considering the causal graph below, in which Age \(A\) is viewed as a mediator
          on the causal path from country \(C\) to case fatility \(F\).
        </p>
        <figure style="text-align: center;">
          <img src='figures/1-4-Fig3.png' alt='graphs' width="350" />
          <figcaption style="font-size: small;">Figure 4.3</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Let's define our causal mechanism more rigorously
        <ul>
          <li>\(C\) : a categorical variable for the country for which CFRs are reported</li>
          <li>\(A\) : an ordinal variable for \(10\)-year-interval age groups of positively tested patients</li>
          <li>\(F\) : a binary variable for whether a patient has died \((F = 1)\) or not \((F = 0)\)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>\(C \rightarrow A\) reflects difference in age demographics between countries</li>
          <li>\(A \rightarrow F\) captures the fact that elderly people have higher risk of contracting the virus
          </li>
          <li>\(C \rightarrow F\) refers to country-specific effects on case fatility other than age, such as medical
            infrastructure, air pollution levels, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions and policies.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Figure 4.3 illustrates a familar setting for Mediation Analysis.
          Separating the data by age groups is equivalent to conditioning on \(A\), which blocks the indirect causal
          path \(C \rightarrow A \rightarrow F\). Thus, the age-specific CFRs only explains the direct effect of \(C\)
          on \(F\). On the other hand, the total rate takes both effects into account,
          and the effect of \(C\) on \(F\) is influenced by the effect from \(A\).
          The authors hypothesizes that CFRs is higher in Italy in total because the population is Italy is older on
          average than China, thus more likely to die from the disease.
          In fact, Figure 4.2 shows that most of the confirmed cases in Itality were reported in
          people aged \(60+\) while the range of China was between \(30\) and \(59\), for whom the virus is less
          dangerous.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the need for cross-country comparison remains, Mediation Analysis comes in handy to disentangle direct
          and indirect effects. The causal difference between two countries is equivalent to the causal effects from
          Here the authors assume no unobserved confounders and \(C\) sufficiently deconfounds
          the \(A \rightarrow F\) relationship. All causal effects are thus identifable through conditional
          probabilities, and equations \((2a)\) and \((2b)\) are applied to measure the natural effects.
        </p>
        <h4>Direct and Indirect Effects on Case Fatility</h4>
        <h5>1. Total Effect</h5>
        <i>What would be the effect on fatality of changing country from China to Italy?</i>
        $$TE = E(F|do(C=Italy)) - E(F|do(C=China)) = E(F|C=Italy) - E(F|C=China) $$

        <h5>2. Controlled Direct Effect</h5>
        <i>What would be the effect on fatality if Chinese \(50-59\)-year-olds were to live in Italy?</i>
        <p>Recall that \(CDE\) is measured at a specific level \(A=a\) of the mediator.</p>
        $$CDE = E(F|do(C=Italy, A=a))-E(F|do(C=China, A=a))$$
        $$= E(F|C=Italy, A=a)-E(F|C=China, A=a)$$

        <h5>3. Natural Direct Effect</h5>
        <i>What would be the effect on fatality of changing country from China to Italy but retaining the age
          distribution of Chinese population?</i>
        <p>An eaiser way is to eliminate all terms containing \(w\) in equation \((2a)\).</p>
        $$NDE = \sum_a [ E(F|C=Italy, A=a) - E(F|C=China, A=a) ] P(A=a|C=China)$$

        <h5>4. Natural Indirect Effect</h5>
        <i>What would be the effect on fatality in China if the age demographics had instead been that of Italy,
          holding everything else unchanged?
        </i>
        $$NIE = \sum_a E(Y|C=China, A=a)[ P(Age=a|C=Italy) - P(Age=a|C=China) ]$$
        <h4>Intepreting Mediation Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          Figure 4.4 compares \(TE\), \(NDE\) and \(NIE\) over time.
        </p>
        <figure style="text-align: center;">
          <img src='figures/1-4-Fig4.png' alt='graphs' width="750" />
          <figcaption style="font-size: small;">Figure 4.4 (taken from the paper): : Evolution of the effects of
            changing country from China to Italy on total CFRs.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          With the Chinese age demographics, it would be beneficial at first for Italy with negative \(NDE\) at the time
          of reporting (9 March). It is the decrease in CFRs that leads to the Italian number being lower
          than those of China in specific age groups. However, \(NIE\) remains high since COVID-19 would have more
          severe impact on China if its population was older, resulting in the higher total aggregated CFRs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The situation gets worse as both \(NDE\) and \(NIE\) goes up over time. This signifies other country-specific
          factors have come into play, possibly overwhelmed heathcare system in Italy. In such a scenario, even the
          younger population would also be susceptible to the disease. In reality, the country did collapse under the
          pandemic during this time due to both old population and fragile medical infrastructure, as reflected in
          \(TE\) with fatility rates continue to sky-rocket.
