Hi ! 

<p>
    You might wonder something must have happened. The answer is no. I am writing this on a day that couldn’t be any more ordinary. I am perfectly fine - emotionally, mentally and financially. But because any day could be my last day, I’d better do this when I am still alive. So, here it is!        
</p>
<p>
    if I ever get kidnapped by an alien, <br>
    if I am forced to chang my name and live in exile,<br>
    if I start living with animals,<br> 
    or if I just simply disappear into thin air,<br><br>
    these are my last word. 

</p>
<h3 style="font-style: italic;">To the people who love me </h3>
<p style="text-indent: 20px">
    The most important thing I want you to know is that I love you back. If after everything you know about me and still your choice is to stay, chances are we must have been on very good terms. I may be approachable at first, but you will soon realize I am a very difficult person to be with.  
</p>
<p>

    I know lots of people but have very few close friends.<br> 
    I set high expectations - for others and even higher for myself.<br> 
    I look down on people and boss them around.<br>  
    I prioritize work over relationships, including family.<br> 
    I overinvest and underinvest at the same time. 
</p>
<p>
    It is very likely that at some point, I fail to be the daughter, the sister, the niece, the student or the friend you deserve, and I am pretty sure that there have been times I hurt your feelings. But the fact that you identify yourself as one in this group means that you choose to overlook my lapses, to forgive me, to accept me for who I am and allow me to have a role in your life. I cannot thank you enough as I know the saying that “this is how I am” is not an excuse. Though I cannot promise to change now and give you more of my attention to be honest, I am right here whenever you need me. I also want to say I’m sorry. You, your love and what we have are what I never take for granted. 
</p>
<h3 style="font-style: italic;">To those that I hurt </h3>
<p style="text-indent: 20px">
    You know, throughout my life, I have been trying not to get too much involved in others’ business. I either care a lot or I don’t care about you at all. I also believe in kindness and I can proudly say I live up to it. So, I guess there’s no such thing that I mistreat you or take advantage of our relationship. That I somehow hurt your feelings can only be because (1) I ignore your messages or (2) you feel being looked down on. 
</p>
<p>
    Too bad, I don’t have any good excuses for these. You are right, they are valid reasons to hold it against a person. Though I myself don’t recall having shamed anyone openly, if you have ever felt attacked or underestimated by me, you must know that it was completely wrong of me to do that, and my opinions should have only been viewed as subjective, biased and prejudicial.  
</p>
<p>
    For people resenting me not treating you the way you thought I should have, my best advice is to stop investing in me (which I truly hope you have) since I am not worth it. In my defense, a reason why I didn’t reciprocate was that I didn’t feel strongly about our connection. I prefer to go with the flow. True relationships will flourish through time and fragile ones will die down quickly. Also, one thing you should learn about me is that I don’t tolerate superficial conversations, gossips nor temporary people.  
</p>
<p>
    Either way, if you still hate me, please do. I don’t blame you. Actually, I should probably be grateful because at least I mean something to you.   
</p>
and ...
<h3 style="font-style: italic;">To those who hurt me</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 20px">
    By fitting yourself into this group, you seem to still remember something about the special bond we had. Since you, my dating life has not gone any better. I end up not seeing any of you ever again, which is probably the best as you know that I cannot get over a person until I fall for someone one new. Even after I do, I still think about you once in a while and reminisce the tiny details that you may have forgotten. 
</p>
<p>
    As I am writing this, I can’t think of many people like that. That’s why when I am in, I am completely in, wholeheartedly devoting to the relationship. I tried so damn hard to work things out but only to see that it didn’t. I was devastated. I had a really difficult time dealing with it, but just so you know I’m getting better. This is to say that I no longer get bothered about our past. As always, I come out of a relationship stronger, wiser and more resilient than I used to be. You picked me up at the right place, the right time, but you just weren’t the right person. If I had to lose you to find myself, then it was all worth it.   
</p>
<h3 style="font-style: italic;">Last words</h3>

<p style="text-indent: 20px">
    By now you may have gone through the entire letter. Unless you fall into one of the categories above, I am sorry to say I am irrelevant to your life and you shouln’t be concerned about whether you have anything to do with me. I have no idea how on earth you end up here, but I hope this isn’t wasting your time.   
</p>
<p>
    After all, I turn out fine. Everything happens for one reason and that is for me to right where I am today. It was rough, but on a bright side, there have been more ups than downs. 
</p>   
<p>
    <strong style="font-style: italic;">To mom and brother,</strong>
    <br>I love you more than enough.<br><br> 
    <strong style="font-style: italic;">To all and others,</strong>
    <br>Thank you for being a wonderful part of my journey. Every single person is unique, and each experience is like no other.   
</p>

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">
    Be bold . Be brave . Be strong . Be unapologetically awesome cause I know you are !

</p>

All the best, 
<br>
Vy
