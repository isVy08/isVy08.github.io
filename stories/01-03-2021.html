          <h1>A Letter to My Loved Ones</h1>
          Hi,
          <p>You might wonder something must have happened. Actually no. I am writing this on a day that couldn’t be any
            more ordinary. I am perfectly fine - physically, emotionally and financially. But because any day could be
            my last day, I’d better do this when I am still alive. So, here it is!</p>
          <p>
            if I ever get kidnapped by an alien, <br>
            if I am forced to chang my name and live in exile, <br>
            if I start living with animals, <br>
            or if I just simply disappear into thin air, <br>
          </p>
          these are my last word.

          <h3>To People Who Love Me</h3>
          <p>The most important thing I want you to know is that I love you back. If after everything you know about me
            and still your choice is to stay, chances are we must have been on very good terms. I may be approachable at
            first, but you will soon realize I am a very difficult person to be with.</p>
          <p>
            I know lots of people but have very few close friends. <br>
            I set high expectations - for others and even higher for myself. <br>
            I look down on people and boss them around. <br>
            I prioritize work over relationships, including family. <br>
            I overinvest and underinvest at the same time. <br>
          </p>
          <p>It is very likely that at some point, I fail to be the daughter, the sister, the niece, the student or the
            friend you deserve, and I am pretty sure that there have been times I hurt your feelings. But the fact that
            you identify yourself as one in this category means that you choose to overlook my lapses, to forgive me, to
            accept me for who I am and allow me to have a role in your life. I cannot thank you enough as I am deeply
            aware that the saying “this is just who I am” is not an excuse. Though I cannot promise to immediately
            change and give you more of my attention to be honest, I am right here whenever you need me. I also want to
            say I’m sorry. You, your love and what we have are what I never take for granted.</p>
          <h3>To Those That I Hurt</h3>
          <p>You know, throughout my life, I have been trying not to get too much involved in others’ business. I either
            care a lot or I don’t care about you at all. I also believe in kindness and I can proudly say I live up to
            it. So, I guess there’s no such thing that I mistreat you or take advantage of our relationship. That I
            somehow hurt your feelings can only be because (1) I ignore your messages or (2) you feel being looked down
            on.</p>
          <p>Too bad, I don’t have any good excuses for either. You are right, they are valid reasons to hold it against
            a person. Though I myself don’t recall having shamed anyone openly, if you have ever felt attacked or
            underestimated by me, you must know that it was completely wrong of me to do so, and my opinions were
            nothing but myopic, biased and prejudicial.</p>
          <p>For people resenting me not treating you the way you thought I should have, my best advice is to stop
            investing in me (which I truly hope you have). I am not really worth it. Also in my defense, another reason
            why I didn’t reciprocate was that I didn’t feel strongly about our connection. Just give it a bit of the
            time, and go with the flow. True relationships will flourish through time and fragile ones will die down
            quickly. And one more thing, I don’t tolerate superficial conversations, gossips and temporary people.</p>
          <p>Either way, if you still hate me, please do. I don’t blame you. Actually, I should probably be grateful
            because at least I mean something to you.</p>
          and...
          <h3>To Guys Who Hurt Me</h3>
          <p>Well, by fitting yourself into this group, you seem to still remember something about the special bond we
            had. Since you, my dating life has not gone any better. I end up not seeing any of you ever again, which is
            probably the best as you know that I have difficulty getting over a person until I fall for someone one new.
            Even after I do, I still think about you once in a while and reminisce the tiny details that you may have
            forgotten.</p>
          <p>As I am writing this, I can’t think of many people like that. That’s why when I'm in, I am completely in,
            wholeheartedly devoting to the relationship. Back then I tried so damn hard to work things out, but only to
            see that it didn’t. I was devastated. I had a really difficult time dealing with it as well, but just so you
            know I’m doing better. This is to say that I no longer get bothered about our past. As always, I come out of
            a relationship stronger, wiser and more resilient than I used to be. You picked me up at the right place,
            the right time, but you just weren’t the right person. If I had to lose you to find myself, then it was all
            worth it.</p>
          <h3>My Final Words</h3>
          <p>By now you may have gone through the entire letter. Unless you fall into one of the categories above, I am
            sorry to say I am irrelevant to your life and you shouln’t be concerned about whether you have anything to
            do with me. I have no idea how on earth you end up here, but I hope this isn’t wasting your time.</p>
          <p>After everything, I turn out fine. They all happened for one reason, and that is for me to be right where I
            am. It's been rough, but on a bright side, there were more ups than downs. I couldn't be any more grateful.
          </p>
          To mom and brother, <br>
          I love you more than enough.
          <p>To all and others, <br>Thank you for being a wonderful part of my journey. Each single one of you is
            unique, and every experience is like no other.</p>

          <p>Be Bold <br> Be Brave <br> Be strong <br> Be unapologetically awesome cause I know you are!</p>
