        <h1>Escape</h1>
        <p>
          Thought I've learned enough lessons,<br>
          But I couldn't be any more wrong<br>
          Just trying to let someone in<br>
          And it stirs up all sorts of emotions.<br>
          <br>
          How can betrayal even work, <br>
          If things are yet to begin?<br>
          After all this time, I still get hurt<br>
          By the little words, <br>
          And a tiny bit of imagination. <br>
          <br>
          I overthink my overthoughts, <br>
          Leaving them entangled, <br>
          Constantly catching me off guard, <br>
          But I never care to pull the brakes<br>
          Keep watching it ride me much too hard.<br>
          <br>
          I build up my own mental prison, <br>
          Abuse it for a brief moment of high,<br>
          Then I trap myself in, for god knows what reason,<br>
          It's the price to pay,<br>
          When you play with fire. <br>
          <br>
          As always, I give it my all,<br>
          It's a do-or-die, that's just how I live,<br>
          I put up the wall when the party is over, <br>
          Picking up the broken pieces, <br>
          Placing them all back together. <br>
          <br>
          It takes courage to not see the world as what it is,<br>
          Rather what it should have been, <br>
          Strangers would say I'm way too idealistic, <br>
          But lots of healing must be done from within. <br>
          <br>
          All you need is a leap of faith<br>
          To move forward,<br>
          And let the misery stay. <br>
          <br>
          Sometimes, <br>
          What you can only do is, <br>
          To sit and wait<br>
          For the pain to come, <br>
          To go away, <br>
          To come back, <br>
          And to be replaced.<br>
