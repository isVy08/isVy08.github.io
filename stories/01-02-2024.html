        <h1>The Child</h1>

        <span>

          He came out to play<br>
          who I never invited<br>
          sobbing in a pool of mud<br>
          for a slight frown of notice.<br>
          <br>
          Years of being unloved<br>
          unattended and uncared for<br>
          Yelling into void<br>
          and befriending blackness.<br>
          <br>
          The arm guards melt in the heat<br>
          of fatigue and resentment<br>
          Down went the tears<br>
          out of bruises and frustration.<br>
          <br>
          When he spoke,<br>
          I stopped listening.<br>
          When he cried,<br>
          I started to judge.<br>
          <br>
          I teared him to shreds for the fragility.<br>
          And I was the one taking all the hurt.<br>
          <br>
          Could you stay silent for a while?<br>
          For now this is enough.<br>
          Don't push me away<br>
          he said<br>
          You're everything that I've got.<br>
          <br>
          Been here since I was 5,<br>
          with lots of baggage<br>
          called goodbyes and regrets<br>
          too much of them drives me crazy<br>
          no matter how hard I suppress.<br>
          <br>
          Into my arms<br>
          I took him.<br>
          Sorry for not loving you enough<br>
          I know too much about the world,<br>
          but still too little about how you exist.<br>
          <br>
          Once and for all,<br>
          let me acknowledge you<br>
          let me set you free so you can grow up<br>
          to see the nature of reality<br>
          things have changed and<br>
          they're full of hopes.<br>
          <br>
          One blink into his little eyes<br>
          goes into my own when I am awake.<br>
          It's me the inner child that's shivering<br>
          whose body that fear overtook.<br>
          <br>
          Let's take some deep breaths<br>
          You are safe here<br>
          No need to run<br>
          Here is home<br>
          Home is now.<br>
          <br>
          Open your eyes<br>
          and step forward<br>
          to me, to the light<br>
          this is the only path.<br>
          Everywhere else is falsity<br>
          it will trap you in the ugly pasts.<br>
          <br>
          Follow the sun<br>
          Touch the light<br>
          Dance peacefully<br>
          beneath the sky.<br>
          <br>
          The whole universe is resting upon you,<br>
          can you see that?<br>
