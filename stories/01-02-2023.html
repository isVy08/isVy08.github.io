        <h1>Fighting for Equality is a Waste of Time</h1>
        <p>
          Tragedy begins the moment you sacrifice your natural being to conform to social constructs.
          Denying your biogloical facts to become identifed with a certain mold of characteristics is a recipe for
          misery.
          The idea underlying modern feminism and transgenderism is hilariously disturbing in the sense that one has to
          change who they are to be considered socially succesful or acceptable,
          while the emphasis has been shifted drastically towards materialistic gains and external validation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is toxic to tell women that building a family is not as important as advancing in their career.
          Stay-at-home mothers should be celebrated, not undermined, since nothing is as difficult, as painful (both
          physically and emotionally) yet impactful as raising the next generation. To achieve what men has, women are
          told to give up on the ability to give birth or even that abortion is desirable where having kids is an
          obstacle. There are biogoligical differences between women and men engrained in our very DNA. You don't need
          to match men's qualities in order to achieve the same level of success (however it is defined).
        </p>
        <p>

          If you are a boy, just because you like to wear dresses or do makeup doesn't mean you should have your
          testicles chopped off. Similarly, if you have an XX chromosome, you are a women and it doesn't make you
          otherwise if you hate playing dolls or sexually attracted to another female. Instead of encouraging the
          society to normalize the fact that a man can have femine characteristics and vice versa, modern transgenderism
          advocates for the notion of "gender reassignment" that calls for surgeries, as if it is biologically wrong in
          the first place. But isn't it cruel to encourage ones to sacrifice their own skin and go through physical
          tortues only to be considered "normal"?
        </p>
        <p>
          Fighting for equality is a waste of time. Equality means everyone is given equal access to resources and
          opportunities, which is not how society works : there are such things called advantages and disadvantages.
          Meanwhile, equity takes personal differences into account and ensures everyone is allocated the right
          resources so that we all can achieve the same outcomes. Today's activism towards gender and race equalty is
          filled up with victim mentality and victomization gets you nowever. It in fact does more harm than good. The
          victimhood culture creats a sense of purposelessness, that no matter how talented and hard-working you are,
          you will never make it until someone else has let go of opportunities they deserve. Things can go out of hand
          when companies continue to assure political correctness disguised under the notion of diversity. Being
          politically correct does not help the minority groups. Imagine that the main reason you are hired for a
          position is because you are a woman, or because you are Asian or black. They are subtle forms of sexism and
          racism. In the long run, everyone in the society including yourself will bear the consequences when jobs are
          not done by those who are qualified. No one should get their way without doing the actual work.
        </p>
        <p>
          To end the misery, one must stop attaching self-worth with externalities, for example, to stop looking to
          other people to properly "gender" you so that you can feel good about yourself. Simply because seeking
          external validation is a forever game in which you can never win.
