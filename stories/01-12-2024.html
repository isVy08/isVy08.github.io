        <h1>The Attic</h1>

        <span>
          And I come in<br>
          It's been waiting here for weeks<br>
          I never showed up until now.<br>
          <br>
          This whole place<br>
          which I would call the attic<br>
          once made out of lost paths and scars.<br>
          <br>
          The attic stays dark but warm,<br>
          as we heal through my downs and ups.<br>
          It lulls me right through the night,<br>
          and weaves sunlight onto my back.<br>
          <br>
          The attic stays the same<br>
          resilient and wholehearted.<br>
          No matter how things change<br>
          It sees through me<br>
          by a sheer drop of breath.<br>
          <br>
          What I left behind resides in the attic<br>
          placed in a muddle across the room.<br>
          They remain unforgotten<br>
          under million films of dust.<br>
          Per my visit<br>
          the flow of memories resumes.<br>
          <br>
          And that was done twice a day<br>
          now I drop by once every six weeks.<br>
          Without a chance of saying hi,<br>
          I'm waving on my way to leave.<br>
          <br>
          Leaving the attic, I was scared.<br>
          The world welcomes me with grand promises.<br>
          I am dazzled by the best of glory<br>
          It's also me haunted by the worst of my ghosts.<br>
          <br>
          The attic is far from complete.<br>
          Look again, it is full of holes.<br>
          Every corner lies an unresolved business,<br>
          and thousand more stories to be retold.<br>
          <br>
          The attic is where<br>
          you're meant to go and come back,<br>
          to grow humble, loving and wise,<br>
          to live a bit more<br>
          to breathe a little deeper,<br>
          to surrender,<br>
          and settle with kindness.<br>
          <br>
          These words are pouring out<br>
          the moment I'm in the attic.<br>
          The fire is on<br>
          as if I've always been around.<br>
          The resilience is well-kept untarnished<br>
          here the lost soul again to be found.<br>
