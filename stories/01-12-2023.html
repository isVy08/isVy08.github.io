        <h1>Homesick</h1>

        <p>

          With enough time alone, I have managed to build a shelter in my heart where I reside, from all kinds of
          disturbances that ongoingly demand my attention. When things get unbearable and every word seems like the last
          straw, I can always find my way back and take refuge within. I would sit under my wisdom and wait patiently
          for the truth to reveal itself. An esoteric aura is quickly formed as a powerful protective shield that
          overfills you with calmness and gratitude. I honestly have no idea how I ended up here. All I know is I have
          been guided, by a mixture of good and evil voices, plus a lot of what is beyond.


        </p>

        <p>

          And I miss home so much. I miss my mom even more. Raising a girl I guess is one of the most difficult things
          ever. As I am, a full bag of emotions. They can pile up like a mountain and even my mom could only wander
          around the foothills. As I grow older, there has come the time I start giving away my heart to some
          stranger. As a parent, it would be such a tortue to watch them play with it freely, something you hold dearly
          and
          delicately
          the whole time she is with you. You can't protect her enough. It would take a lot of courage in a mother to
          let the kid out in the world, and a lot of faith in the universe to take a good care of her. I am doing my
          best and life indeed has treated me well. My mom has done the best job ever and she can now rest assured at
          the back seat.

        </p>

        <p>
          Breaking free comes with a price. Once I am in, I am in. I know it is foolish of me and I run the risk of
          hurting myself. If everything fell apart, it would collapse altogether and I would lose myself completely. I
          will be able to restore it, but it will take time. At that moment, the only shelter I need would be her arms,
          knowing that I will be safe there and it will never change. It's a bit embarassing to only begin loving your
          mother more at this age, when most of the fun runs out. But people are really cruel sometimes.

        </p>

        <p>
          The more you detach from most things, the more attached you become to what remains. This yin-and-yang dynamics
          develops so subtly yet fiercely, and even more so the moment you choose what to let in and what to let go.
        </p>

        Home is in my mom's embrace.<br>
        Home is as far as Vietnam but can be right here.<br>
        Home exists within and without others knowing.<br>
        Home is now in my heart, wheverer peace settles in.
