        <h1>This is me trying</h1>

        <span>
          To the heaviness in my soul,<br>
          let the words carry the burden<br>
          let them run wild in chaos<br>
          and fall into place on their own.<br>
          <br>
          What hurt you hurt me times a million.<br>
          I was at fault for what really happened.<br>
          It backfired like never before,<br>
          crashed and burned right to my core.<br>
          <br>
          It doesn't take a full year,<br>
          for the damn cycle to repeat.<br>
          It's the same old path I can notice,<br>
          whose ending I am way too familiar with.<br>
          <br>
          I'm stuck between some half-ass loves<br>
          that aren't even worth given names.<br>
          Eventually I'll be fucking them up.<br>
          It's always a knock-out, but here I go again.<br>
          <br>
          Sorry I didn't catch the rhythme,<br>
          but who really gives a shit.<br>
          Fuck that I'm just jamming,<br>
          as if anyone out there woud read.<br>
          <br>
          The question pounds my head,<br>
          what's the sacrifice for this achievement.<br>
          If enstrangement is the resounding yes,<br>
          then at least I'm going with the current.<br>
          Okay, I was wrong to ask.<br>
          Confusion leads us to nowhere.<br>
          I can't be speaking up for the truth,<br>
          while acting out from lies at the root.<br>
          <br>
          About this long,<br>
          I hold on to.<br>
          Is it the beach,<br>
          my dad or<br>
          a twin flame?<br>
          <br>
          If one has to be the bad guy,<br>
          let me take on the hard job.<br>
          So, this is me trying,<br>
          on my second attempt.<br>
          Now it's getting harder than I thought<br>
          I seem to underestimate it<br>
          The signals are disturbing,<br>
          among those rampant messages.<br>
          <br>
          Long live the memories<br>
          Hope they'll transcend this fleeting lifetime<br>
          You stay peace wherever you're at<br>
          Forgot, fogetting and forgotten,<br>
          Us, me and our existence.<br>
