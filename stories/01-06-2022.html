        <h1>An Affair</h1>
        <p>
          Please take my hand while this moment lasts<br>
          Cause soon enough time would wash it away<br>
          It's an unknown land with barely any dwellers<br>
          No need to be disguised or afraid,<br>
          Everyone's here just strangers.<br>

          <br>
          Turn off our phones for a few seconds<br>
          Escape the city for a couple of days<br>
          Don't worry darling, my man is at work<br>
          And your daughter is at school.<br>
          <br>
          Please hold my hand when the sun goes down<br>
          You're on a business trip and I'm back to my hometown<br>
          Beauty is the daylight kissing your cheek<br>
          Cruelty is the midnight breeding my prick.<br>
          <br>
          Does this feel any right to you?<br>
          As we're slipping through cracks of greys<br>
          Infidelity smells so brand new<br>
          Where integrity doesn't have a say.<br>
          <br>
          It's not your fault to have a run-away bride<br>
          It's not my fault when he lives across the globe<br>
          I completely lost it when he's out of sight<br>
          But, it's not his fault that I loved you first.<br>
          <br>
          Let's right here pick up where we left of<br>
          And keep writing our unfinished story<br>
          Intimacy runs as far as the breeze goes<br>
          We dug it up and it's time to have it buried.<br>
          <br>
          Leave my hand, then would you drop it?<br>
          Cause yours not been promised to mine<br>
          A new start soon be another misstep<br>
          If it's built up from tons of lies.<br>
          <br>
          A word with "s" is the sharpest sword<br>
          A man with guilt is the toughest judge<br>
          Forgive me when I wanted a pause,<br>
          For I cannot see us in trust.<br>
          <br>
          Please drop my hand when the sun goes up<br>
          Holding on to yours is the best and worst of life<br>
          I'm happy placing you back to your spot<br>
          As my heart's set free and so is my mind.<br>
