        <h1>Old Friend</h1>
        <p>
          Never thought I would drop by<br>
          As almost about to leave<br>
          The voice of yours took me by surprise<br>
          The temptation I could not resist<br>
          <br>
          The smell brought me back years ago<br>
          Memories wrapped in fragrant roses<br>
          Nicely laying on our way to school<br>
          You looked at me, I looked away, who could I fool ?<br>
          <br>
          How do I even begin ?<br>
          You followed me on the same old street<br>
          Filled with bumps and rainwater holes<br>
          Secretively and privately, until we were home.<br>
          <br>
          No one knew and no one had to know<br>
          I put up guards, you dated her just for show<br>
          Lovingly hated you in disguise<br>
          "I don't care if he lives or dies"<br>
          <br>
          Hey, old friend,<br>
          Can I call you that ?<br>
          Where has all the time flown ?<br>
          Promise me a dazzling future ahead<br>
          But not a warning against the regrets?<br>
          <br>
          Hey, old friend<br>
          Has the time treated you well ?<br>
          Over those years I've been on your trail<br>
          Busy making ends meet in a coffee shop ?<br>
          where your finesse finally pays off<br>
          <br>
          Someone walked me to your orphanage<br>
          Which you never mentioned was dark and cold<br>
          And school to you was an awful cage<br>
          but it is my shiniest throne<br>
          <br>
          How do I even begin ?<br>
          You were behind me on that same old street<br>
          Filled with bumps and rainwater holes<br>
          Secretively and privately, until we were home<br>
          <br>
          That was before you took a wrong turn<br>
          That was when I couldn't breathe<br>
          A dropout is what they called you<br>
          The rumor no one wants to believe<br>
          <br>
          Hey, old friend<br>
          What could have changed ?<br>
          when I became a girl that's more than a friend,<br>
          How the road not taken should have been?<br>
          When you became my truest dream<br>
          <br>
          No one's talked about you since<br>
          I really wish someone did<br>
          Anamesis seems like a good old habit<br>
          Mourning for an old friend's demise<br>
          <br>
          How do I even begin ?<br>
          You're laid behind a well cut glass<br>
          In this very room where roses are scattered<br>
          where the dress code is either white or black<br>
          <br>
          This is our way to school<br>
          I'm following you on this very old street<br>
          There's no more bumps or rainwater holes<br>
          I look at you, you smile away, what a fool !<br>
