SIDE NOTE:

Hi sis here is briefly break down the structure of your Webpage

I used Grid system to manage the page instead of flexbox. Don't worry about this 
part I've done all of the heavy work and you just need to insert your article based on my 
manual. That would save you a bit of time :))

About the main.js don't worry about it either. I will enhance that part soon.

MAIN NOTE:

- MATH FORMULAS AND SYMBOLS:
    + If it is inline with the text, use \(\). First execute the HTML format in "Mathjax" using "TeX" format.
        For instance b^2 (b to the power of 2) will be written as \(b^2\).
    + If you wanted to insert the entire formula then also use the "Tex" format. However, use $${}$$ instead of \(\)
        For instance, $${g(\mu) = \mu = W^TX}$$ where the formula should be written within the { __ } bracket.

- HEADING AND SECTION TITLE: 
    + HEADING: A Heading of article you should use <h1> tag.  
    + SECTION TITLE: Use <h3> tag. 

- REFERENCING: 
    Create an <ul> tag and then <li> tag. Then put class="italic-text" to ensure the text is in italic
    Here is the sample: (You might as well just copy and paste it).
    <ul class="italic-text"> 
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>

- BOLD AND ITALIC TEXT WITHIN THE ARTICLE OR PARAGRAPH: 
    Create a <span> tag then: 
        + If you wanted the text to be bold --> class="bold-text" (Copy and paste to your desired text).
            <span class="bold-text">(Insert the text here)</span>
        
        + If you wanted to text to be italic --> class="italic-text" (Copy and paste as well).
            <span class="italic-text">(Insert the text here)</span>

- PARAGRAPH:
    Each paragraph will be used a single <p> tag just to make sure that the structure is clear and easy to maintain.
