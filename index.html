        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> 
          This is Vy /vi:/. <br>
          I am an AI researcher, working at the intersection of Linguistics, AI and Reasoning while envision a future dominated by intelligent machines that can reason and communicate effectively.
          I am currently exploring Causal ML, that is how to teach machines to reason cause and effects.<br><br>  
          
          I am a life enthusiast. I do all what it takes to have a life well-lived: write, love, talk, travel, contemplate and eat good food. 
          Apart from AI, I also write about what's like to be human and personal struggles which I learn and grow mostly from. 
          Free time to me is a luxury, but when do have it, I watch rom-coms and build tools for learning English.       
        </p>
        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>
            My experiences vary. I had a Bachelor's degree in Business with around 3 years working in Sales, Media Production and Growth Marketing before changing my career. Now I am about to graduate from Monash University with a MS in Data Science. 
            A significant portion of my early 20s was spent on learning about human's decision making process, only to wonder whether machines will someday be able to do the same. 
            I pursue research mainly because I am intrigued by problem-solving ideas, and learning makes me feel so good about myself. 
        </p>
        <h2>What's Else</h2>
        <p>Before everything now, I was quite an extrovert
        <ul>
            <li>I led a team of 100+ members organizing <a style='color:blue; text-decoration: underline; '; href="https://cmothinkandaction.com">CMO Think & Action</a> - one of the largest national Marketing contests for university students in Vietnam. Mine was Season 3, and our Season 7 was just wrapped up.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I helped launch the first workshop <a style='color:blue; text-decoration: underline; '; href="https://www.womenmeettech.org/">Women Meet Tech</a> that teaches young women to code and encourages them to pursue tech. That was before it makes its name and gets funded by U.S. Department of State & the U.S. Consulate General HCMC.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I was a key member of <a style='color:blue; text-decoration: underline; '; href="https://leanin.org/circles/lean-in-viet-nam#!">Lean In Vietnam</a> and hosted the first Lean In circle in Ho Chi Minh city. Lean In is a global community dedicated to helping women achieve their ambitions founded by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I lived in <span class='bold-text'>Europe</span> for 3 months where I fell in love with baking. </li> 
            <br>
            <li>I used to be an <span class='bold-text'>assistant manager</span> for a bubble tea shop in Melbourne, where I got to meet and work with people from all walks of life. As we parted ways, I found the self that I lost, and priceless lessons on management, teamwork and relationship.</li> 
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>If you are like-minded, I would love to stay in touch. Also, everything on this site is open sourced, but it would be nice to drop me a message at <strong>vyvo2608@gmail.com</strong> ðŸ˜Š
