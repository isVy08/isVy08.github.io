          This is Vy /vi:/. <br>
          <img alt="Vy Vo" src="assets/profile.jpg" height="250" style="float: right; max-width: 37%; margin: 0 0 1em 2em; border-radius: 800px ">
          
          I'm a researcher and it happens to be about AI. In this crazy era, there is no limit to what you must study, and any wildest imagination can become the next big thing. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Above all, I am a devoted student of causality. Life to me is nothing but a vast labyrinth of causes and effects, which we yearn to be disentangled from. 
          To reason causally is to understand the essence of intelligence, the universe, and ourselves. 
          
        </p>

        <p>
          There is a certain wonder in tracing these threads while envisioning a future dominated by intelligent machines. May the wiser creatures prevail.
        </p>

          As a life enthusiast, I do all what it takes to have a life well-lived: write, love, talk, travel, contemplate
          and eat good food. As a keen writer, I'm engaged in various forms of storytelling: from event scripts, screenplays to musicals, song lyrics and poetry.
        </p>
        

        <h2>Background</h2>              
        <p>
          I graduated from a Business school and spent around 3 years in Sales, Media Production and Growth
          Marketing before taking a leap of faith. Now I am a PhD Candidate at Monash University, gratefully funded by CSIRO's Data61, Australia.

        <!-- <h2>What's Else</h2>
        <p>Before everything now, I was quite an extrovert
        <ul>

          <li>I helped launch the first workshop <a style='color:blue; text-decoration: underline; ' ;
              href="https://www.womenmeettech.org/">Women Meet Tech</a> that teaches young women to code and encourages
            them to pursue tech. That was before it makes its name and gets funded by U.S. Department of State & the
            U.S. Consulate General HCMC.</li>
          <br>
          <li>I was a key member of <a style='color:blue; text-decoration: underline; ' ;
              href="https://leanin.org/circles/lean-in-viet-nam#!">Lean In Vietnam</a> and hosted the first Lean In
            circle in Ho Chi Minh city. Lean In is a global community dedicated to helping women achieve their ambitions
            founded by former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg.</li>
          <br>
          <li>I led a team of 100+ members organizing <a style='color:blue; text-decoration: underline; ' ;
              href="https://www.cmothinkandaction.com/">CMO Think & Action</a> (Season 3) - one of the largest national
            Marketing
            contests for university students in Vietnam. Our Season 10 is on.</li>
          <br>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>If you are like-minded, I would love to stay in touch. Everything on this site
          is open sourced, but it
          would be nice to let me know what you're working on ðŸ˜Š
