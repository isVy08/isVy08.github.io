        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          This is Vy /vi:/. <br>
          I'm an AI researcher. My research interests are Causal Inference and Statistical Machine Learning. I am
          studying artificial causal reasoning while envisioning a future dominated by intelligent
          machines that can reason and communicate effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a life enthusiast, I do all what it takes to have a life well-lived: write, love, talk, travel, contemplate
          and eat good food.
          I'm a keen writer, engaged in various forms of content writing: from academic papers, event scripts,
          to screenplays, musicals, song lyrics and poetry.
        </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I had a Bachelor's degree in Business with around 3 years working in Sales, Media Production and Growth
          Marketing before changing my career. I am currently a PhD Researcher at Monash University, affiliated with
          CSIRO's Data61, Australia.
        </p>
        <h2>What's Else</h2>
        <p>Before everything now, I was quite an extrovert
        <ul>

          <li>I helped launch the first workshop <a style='color:blue; text-decoration: underline; ' ;
              href="https://www.womenmeettech.org/">Women Meet Tech</a> that teaches young women to code and encourages
            them to pursue tech. That was before it makes its name and gets funded by U.S. Department of State & the
            U.S. Consulate General HCMC.</li>
          <br>
          <li>I was a key member of <a style='color:blue; text-decoration: underline; ' ;
              href="https://leanin.org/circles/lean-in-viet-nam#!">Lean In Vietnam</a> and hosted the first Lean In
            circle in Ho Chi Minh city. Lean In is a global community dedicated to helping women achieve their ambitions
            founded by former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg.</li>
          <br>
          <li>I led a team of 100+ members organizing <a style='color:blue; text-decoration: underline; ' ;
              href="https://www.cmothinkandaction.com/">CMO Think & Action</a> (Season 3) - one of the largest national
            Marketing
            contests for university students in Vietnam. Our Season 10 is on.</li>
          <br>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>If you are like-minded, I would love to stay in touch. Everything on this site
          is open sourced, but it
          would be nice to let me know what you're working on ðŸ˜Š
