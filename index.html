            <h2>Who is Me</h2>
            <p> Vy Vo is my name, and it's pronounced /vi:/ similarly to how you say the letter V. 
                <br>I'm an AI researcher, though I don't think a profession should define who I am. I currently work in the intersection of Linguistics, AI and Reasoning, which is motivated by my undivided attention towards 3 areas
                <ul>
                <li>How humans think</li>
                <li>How we produce languages</li>
                <li>How to build an intelligent machine doing the same thing</li>
                </ul>
                I am a life enthusiast. I do all what a human being who wishes to get the most out of his life is supposed to do: 
                write, love, talk, travel, contemplate and eat good food. Apart from AI, I also write about what's like to be human and my personal struggles which I learn and grow mostly from. 
                I engage in a lot of philosophical and intellectual activities, and as my energy gets depleted very quickly, my attention is strictly limited to topics I care about and very few people I love.  
            </p>
            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>
                My experiences vary. My undergraduate degree was in Business, and I had around 3 years working in Sales, Media Production and Growth Marketing before changing my career. Now I am about to graduate from Monash University with a MS in Data Science. I am not originally a scientist by training, but all of my previous positions involved a great deal of planning, research and analysis. I pursue research mainly because I am intrigued by problem-solving ideas, and learning makes me feel so good about myself. 
            </p>
            <h2>What's Else</h2>
            <p>Before everything now, I was quite an extrovert
            <ul>
                <li>I led a team of 100+ members hosting <a style='color:blue; text-decoration: underline; ';="https://cmothinkandaction.com">CMO Think & Action</a> - one of the largest national Marketing contests for university students in Vietnam. Mine was Season 3, and it's now Season 7.</li>
                <li>I helped launch the first workshop <a style='color:blue; text-decoration: underline; ';="https://www.womenmeettech.org/">Women Meet Tech</a> that teaches young women to code and encourages them to pursue tech. That was before it makes its name and gets funded by U.S. Department of State & the U.S. Consulate General HCMC.</li>
                <li>I was a key member of <a style='color:blue; text-decoration: underline; ';="https://leanin.org/circles/lean-in-viet-nam#!">Lean In Vietnam</a> and hosted the first Lean In circle in Ho Chi Minh city. Lean In is a global community dedicated to helping women achieve their ambitions founded by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg.</li>
                <li>I lived in <span class='bold-text'>Europe</span> for 3 months where fell in love with pastry. I love baking, but suck at it ! </li> 
                <li>I used to be an <span class='bold-text'>assistant manager</span> for a bubble tea shop in Melbourne. I got to meet and work with people from all walks of life, who had nothing in common with me but insanely good hearts. As we parted ways, I found the self that I lost, along with priceless lessons on management, teamwork and relationship.</li> 
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>I am open to discuss almost anything. Whatever on this site is open sourced, 
                but it would be nice to drop an email letting me know what you are working on. Or you can simply cite me :)
