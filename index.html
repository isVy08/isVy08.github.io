        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> Vy Vo is my name, and it's pronounced /vi:/ similarly to how you say the letter V. 
            <br>I'm an AI researcher, though I don't think a profession should define who I am. I currently work in the intersection of Linguistics, AI and Reasoning, which is motivated by my undivided attention towards 3 areas
            <ul>
            <li>How humans think</li>
            <li>How we produce languages</li>
            <li>How to build an intelligent machine doing the same thing</li>
            </ul>
            I am a life enthusiast. I do all what a human being, who wishes to get the most out of his life, is supposed to do: 
            write, love, talk, travel, contemplate and eat good food. Apart from AI, I also write about what's like to be human and personal struggles which I learn and grow mostly from. 
            I engage in a lot of philosophical and intellectual activities, and as my energy gets depleted very quickly, my attention is strictly limited to topics I care about and very few people I love.  
        </p>
        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>
            My experiences vary. My undergraduate degree was in Business, and I had around 3 years working in Sales, Media Production and Growth Marketing before changing my career. Now I am about to graduate from Monash University with a MS in Data Science. I am not originally a scientist by training, but all of my previous positions involved a great deal of planning, research and analysis. I pursue research mainly because I am intrigued by problem-solving ideas, and learning makes me feel so good about myself. 
        </p>
        <h2>What's Else</h2>
        <p>Before everything now, I was quite an extrovert
        <ul>
            <li>I led a team of 100+ members hosting <a style='color:blue; text-decoration: underline; ';="https://cmothinkandaction.com">CMO Think & Action</a> - one of the largest national Marketing contests for university students in Vietnam. Mine was Season 3, and our Season 7 was just wrapped up.</li>
            <li>I helped launch the first workshop <a style='color:blue; text-decoration: underline; ';="https://www.womenmeettech.org/">Women Meet Tech</a> that teaches young women to code and encourages them to pursue tech. That was before it makes its name and gets funded by U.S. Department of State & the U.S. Consulate General HCMC.</li>
            <li>I was a key member of <a style='color:blue; text-decoration: underline; ';="https://leanin.org/circles/lean-in-viet-nam#!">Lean In Vietnam</a> and hosted the first Lean In circle in Ho Chi Minh city. Lean In is a global community dedicated to helping women achieve their ambitions founded by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg.</li>
            <li>I lived in <span class='bold-text'>Europe</span> for 3 months where I fell in love with pastry. I love baking, but suck at it ! </li> 
            <li>I used to be an <span class='bold-text'>assistant manager</span> for a bubble tea shop in Melbourne, where I got to meet and work with people from all walks of life. They had nothing in common with me except insanely good hearts. As we parted ways, I found the self that I lost, along with priceless lessons on management, teamwork and relationship.</li> 
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I am open to discuss almost anything. Whatever on this site is open sourced, 
            but it would be nice to drop a message letting me know what you are working on :)
